A basic clock program

Clock is initalized to January 1, 1970

While the universe is of the year 26XX, it appears that the emulated clock overflows at 2309, and underflows at 1724.

The clock also appears to be 13 minutes behind my system clock.  My time zone of UTC-5 seems to also affect the clock.
