A very basic text editor to test keyboard interaction.

Using the Smart Text mode of the Generic Keyboard, characters are directly written to video ram.  Key repetition seems to be supported; charactes are repeated while a key is held down.  Interupts are fired based on system settings (delay and repeat rate).
